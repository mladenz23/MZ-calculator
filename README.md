# MZ-retro-calculator

This is a simple retro calculator I've made a
while back.

I've used basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript, without
any libraries.

There's nothing to fancy about it, just the JS
basics to get me going into building my own stuff
from scratch.

The calculator has basic features like addition,
subtraction, multiplication and division, along
with decimal separator and clear buttons. I've
additionally added the percentage calculation
and clear single digit/operator buttons to make
it less dull.

Note:
I've been told I should not use eval method for
calculating the result, but it's a project from
a while back. I'll leave it as it is so I can
reflect on it in the future when my skill level
(hopefully) gets better. :)

I might upgrade this in the future to something
more advanced.
